# OS Window/Tab Manager Simulation üñ•Ô∏è

Welcome to the **OS Window/Tab Manager Simulation**, a project that demonstrates how to efficiently manage windows and tabs using a **LinkedList** data structure, integrated with a visual interface built with **JavaFX**.

## Project Overview

This simulation mimics the functionality of an operating system's window and tab management. With a clean and intuitive user interface, users can manage windows and tabs dynamically with ease.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Data Structure**: Utilizes a **LinkedList** to simulate window/tab management for quick
